#  Dussehra Sales Analysis Using Python 

Welcome to the **Dussehra Sales Analysis** project — a practical deep dive into the world of **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** using Python. this project offers a real-world dataset to help you strengthen your data analysis skills.

##  Project Overview

Data Analysis, especially **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**, is one of the most critical steps in any data science project. It helps us understand the underlying patterns, detect outliers, clean the data, and set the stage for further modeling or business insights.

In this project, we explore a **Dussehra festival sales dataset**, which contains customer purchase behavior during the festive season. Festivals like Dussehra often drive huge spikes in consumer spending — making this a rich dataset for analysis.

##  Project Description

✔️ Performed **data cleaning** and **data manipulation** using Python  
✔️ Conducted **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** with:
- `Pandas`
- `NumPy`
- `Matplotlib`
- `Seaborn`

✔️ Improved customer experience by identifying **potential customers** across:
- States
- Occupations
- Gender
- Age groups

✔️ Helped improve sales by identifying:
- **Top-selling product categories**
- **High-demand products**  
These insights assist in inventory planning and meeting customer demand effectively.

##  Key Insights

-  **Married women aged 26–35** from **Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, and Karnataka**, working in **IT, Healthcare, and Aviation**, are **more likely to purchase** during Dussehra.
-  Most popular product categories:
  - **Food**
  - **Clothing**
  - **Electronics**
-  These customer segments are valuable for targeted marketing and promotional campaigns.
